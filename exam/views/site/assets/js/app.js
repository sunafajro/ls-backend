The planet at the edge of the solar system was called Pluto, after the Roman god.

The general truth is that the best way to win an argument is to avoid it but this is not always possible. If you have to confront a challenging point of view, show maximum respect for the other person\'s opinion and never say «You\'re wrong». Your chances to take the upper hand will rise if you talk in a friendly way and carefully ask questions to which the other person will answer «Yes». Interestingly, social psychologists have noticed that a very good strategy is to let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Listen attentively for the weak points. If you want your ideas to win, make the other person feel as if your ideas are his or hers. Make every effort to see honestly the things from the other person\'s point of view.

Many animals reach full growth within a year. Others are fully grown in just a few years. Birds and insects also stop growing at a certain age. But trees keep growing as long as they live. Trees live, grow, and reproduce themselves by an amazing process. The thousands of leaves put forth by the tree breathe for it and manufacture its food. Its root system gathers minerals and vast quantities of water. To carry this water to the leaves, the tree is equipped with an intricate circulation system that extends upward from the millions of root hairs through the trunk and branches. The trunk holds the leaves up to the sunlight, sends them water from the roots, and gets food back from them. Then seeds are borne in flowers or cones.","audio":null,"images":[],"questions":[],"sequentialQuestions":false,"questionsInterval":0,"selectableImages":false,"note":"","prepareTime":89,"recordTime":89},{"id":2,"title":"Study the advertisement.","description":"You are considering going to the new fast food restaurant and now you\'d like to get more information.

He made it to the top of the world\'s highest peak a week before the 50th anniversary of the first ascent. The old man himself, his son and seven others reached the summit via the south-east ridge route taken in 1953. The headmaster and former professional skier was one of many people to scale Everest on that day. He said it was a dream come true. He shattered the record previously held by another Japanese man, who was 65 when he conquered Everest last year. A record number of people are on the mountain to mark the anniversary. But until successful ascents from the north side, bad weather had thwarted all attempts this year. There have been fears that the large numbers climbing at the same time could create the potential for disaster.
